        <p class="mb-4">
        Get ready to hit the ground running – literally! Unlike conventional platformers where you control the character's movements, our game flips the script by putting you in charge of the platforms themselves. The character is in constant motion, steadily picking up speed as time progresses. Your task? Manipulate the height of the platforms to guide the character safely through the treacherous terrain.

        By tapping and holding the left side of the screen, you can elevate the platforms, providing a path for the character to traverse. Timing is key as you navigate through the ever-accelerating environment, avoiding obstacles and strategically positioning platforms to ensure a smooth journey.

        As you navigate through the fast-paced landscape, keep an eye out for valuable coins scattered across the platforms. These coins serve as currency in our in-game shop, allowing you to purchase essential items and power-ups to enhance your gameplay experience.
